                    My background in Economics has provided me with a unique lens through which I approach development. I recognize the importance
                    of web development, critical thinking, and problem-solvingâ€”skills honed during my academic pursuits. The combination of economic
                    principles and coding proficiency enables me to approach software development projects with a holistic perspective, considering both
                    the technical and business aspects.
